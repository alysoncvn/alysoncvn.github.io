##### project with other people as you can all work on the file at the same time and it is easy to 
##### consolidate your work.  

### What kind of files/info should be saved in a Git repository? What types of 
### files/info should not be included in a Git repository?
##### Large data files can be saved in a Git repository. However, data that you do not
